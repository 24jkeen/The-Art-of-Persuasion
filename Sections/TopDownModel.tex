\subsection{Top Down Model}

A second method for creating absolute arguments is proposed here that considers the assertion as a whole. Where the previous model constructed the assertion from an empty set, the Top Down approach goes through a similar process in reverse. Consider \cref{fig:hesse} as a form of search tree to serve as an example. Beginning at $W = \{S_1, S_2, S_3 \}$, this scheme iteratively removes states from consideration, descending the tree, until the probability of the assertion is below a certain threshold $\gamma$. This prevents the speaker from asserting an argument that it did not have enough probability in as a whole. This can be written as 

\begin{equation} \label{eq:TD_approach}
    \mathbf{A} = \{ S_i: p(\mathbf{S}) \leq \gamma  \}
\end{equation}


It is clear that this method aims to propose the most specific assertion it can, removing states for which $p_i$ is low however it scales badly at $O(2^n)$. It should be noted that, for both models, $\gamma$ is imposed to prevent the speaker making statements for which is has low probability. However, in the top down approach the significance applies to the argument as a whole and so is a much less prescriptive condition.
